Quality Managment System for Medical Devices from scratch

## Table of Contents
🚧 Working on 🚧:

- [Document Control](#document-control)

Future modules:

- CAPA Managment 


## Document Control

The goal of document control is to approve, review, distribute and obsolesce documents without losing traceability

### General documents that need to be tracked

Documents

- Quality manual.
- Quality policy and Quality objectives.
- Documented procedures (SOP, WIs, CAPAs, Internal Audits, Document control strategy).
- External documents.

Records

- Documents relating to the medical device (IFU, labels, ...)
- Design and development records
- Medical Device File (ISO) / Device Master Record (FDA)
- Device History Record
- Purchasing records
- Records of production, controls, assays, CAPAs, audits.

### ISO 13485:2018

For each document the following requirement need to be met:

- Identify the current revision status and changes.
- Documents shall remain legible and easily identifiable.
- The current version shall be available at the points of use.
- Prevent the unintended use of obsolete documents and be identified as obsolete.
- Keep at least one copy of obsolete documents during the life cycle of the device or according to the applicable regulations.
- Have a documented procedure to identify, archive, protect and retrive records.
- Records need to be kept during the life cycle fo the device or acording to the applicable regulations. 

### Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 820

The organization shall:

- Establish and maintain documented procedures to control all the documents required by Part 820.
- Designate individuals to review and approve the documents before issuance, the approval process shall be documented including date and signature.
- Obsolete documents shall be removed from all points of use or otherwise prevented from unintended use.
- The records shall remain legible and stored to prevent loss or deterioration.
- Keep the records for the expected life cycle of the device, at least two years from comercial distribution.

### Diferences:

Regarding to document control, both aplicable regulations are very similar since both require:

- Documented procedure to control documents
- Obsolete docuemtns to be retained and clearly indentified
- Records to be safely stored and accessible thoughout the life cycle of the product
- Defined responsabilites and authorities for the creation, review, approval, distribution and control of the documents and records

The main diferences between both regulations are:

- FDA requiers date and signature to approve changes
- FDA has DMR and DHR while ISO (and MDR) uses the Medical Device File
- In terms of handling obsolete documents, the FDA uses a more directe approach (removing), while ISO 13485 uses a risk-based approach (prevent uninteded use)
